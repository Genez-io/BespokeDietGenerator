## CraveAPI Command Line Utility

This is an example of how the Bespoke Diet Generator API can be used.

Our API uses the transformative power of algorithms to generate bespoke nutritional plans based on whole ingredients, just like you would get from a great nutritionist. 

Instead of getting countless recipes or broad meal templates, our algorithm generates uniquely specific meal plans that are easy to follow.

The command line utility has the following commands:

- helloworld: prints back helloworld.
- createUser: creates a new user.
- generateDiet: generates a diet for a specific user.
- getIngredients: get all the ingredients.
- setExcludedIngredients: set the list of ingredients that a user does not want in its diet.
- replaceIngredient: replace an ingredient in an existing recipe.
